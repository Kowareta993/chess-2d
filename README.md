# chess-2d
## Description
Object oriented implementation of a simple chess game using java swing package. Only basic moves are implemented. Win condition is hitting enemy king piece (checkmate and checking in general is not implemented).
You can play it against minimax agent or against another player locally. Minimax agent code is given to me and its poorly designed.
